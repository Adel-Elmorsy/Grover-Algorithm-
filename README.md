# Grover-Algorithm-
in phase_1 we did an Qiskit Implementation of Grover's algorithm. first we desined an oracle to search for a state in a space of 8 dimension then we generalized that and built an oracle to search for a state in an N dimensional space and applied that to a problem with search space of 2^9 dimension.

In phase_2 we solved the "Lights Out Puzzle" Using Grover's Algorithm. 


the notebooks have detailed explaination for every step
